This website was coded using the Acceptance Criteria mentioned below:
- WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information, THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input

- WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML, THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address

- WHEN I click on the GitHub username, THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab

- WHEN I start the application, THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number

- WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number, THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team

- WHEN I select the engineer option, THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
